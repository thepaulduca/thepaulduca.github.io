	<p>There are 6 strings on most guitars, classic tuning from top to bottom are:</p>
		
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>E</td>
				<td>A</td>
				<td>D</td>
				<td>G</td>
				<td>B</td>
				<td>E</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

	<p>This is traditional tuning and for the most part this is the tuning your guitar will be in. Some songs and generes (heavy metal) use drop D tuning where the first string is tuned down to D, or other tuning variations. There are some guitars which have more strings 7 or 8 or double strings where each string has a smaller secound string adjecent to it making a total of <strong>twelve</strong> string on the guitar. 

	Playing the strings will at first hurt your fingers but <em>slowly</em> your hand will get use to it!
